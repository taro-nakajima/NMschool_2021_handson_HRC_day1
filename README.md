# Hands-on experiments at HRC(BL12), NM school 2021

## Introduction
 This webpage shows the outline of the on-line hands-on training of HRC spectrometer in MLF of J-PARC and sample programs for the training. 
 
## Outline
1. A brief review of inelastic neutron scattering.
2. Overview of HRC spectrometer. 
3. Examples of experiments at HRC (CsFeCl<sub>3</sub> under pressure, SrRuO<sub>3</sub> Neutron Brillouin scattering) 
4. Procedures of neutron inelastic scattering experiment.
    1. How to make a plan for an inelastic scattering experiment.
    2. How to determine an appropriate incident energy (TOF diagram)
    3. Multi-Ei method.
    4. _Q-E_ trajectories in a 2D reciprocal lattice space (single crystal). 

### Problem 1: 
Calculate a phase offset for the target _E_<sub>i</sub>. 

[gnuplot script for problem 1](/problem1/plot_TOF_diagram_single.txt).

### Problem 2: 
Calculate other Eis when the target Ei of 160 meV is obtained by rotating the Fermi chopper with a frequency of 200 Hz. gnuplot script 

### Problem 3: 
Calculate Q-E trajectories for Ei=160 meV.  gnuplot script
